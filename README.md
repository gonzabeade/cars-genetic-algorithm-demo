# Car Driving Simulation with Genetic Algorithm

This project demonstrates a simple genetic algorithm used to train cars to drive through a square circuit. The code was presented during a talk at St. Ciaran's Secondary School.

## Overview

The simulation employs a straightforward genetic algorithm to show how cars learn to navigate a circuit with checkpoints. Despite its simplicity, this implementation successfully trains the cars to drive around the track in approximately 60 generations.

## Installation 

It is recommended you install a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. 

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## Thanks 

A special thanks to St. Ciaran's School for providing the space and opportunity to present this project. Your support and engagement are greatly appreciated.
